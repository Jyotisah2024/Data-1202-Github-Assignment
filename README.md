# Data-1202-Github-Assignment
# Project Title
SQL Database Connection and Query Execution
# Project Description
This project provides a guide for connecting to a SQL database, executing simple and complex queries, and reading the results into a pandas DataFrame. The objective is to facilitate data analysis and manipulation using Python, allowing for efficient data processing.
# Getting Started Prerequisites
To create the environment and run the project, you'll need the following software:

**Python** (3.6+)
**SQLAlchemy** (database connections)
**Pandas** (used for data manipulation)
**SQL databases** (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite)

# Running the tests.
**End-to-end tests.**
To ensure that the data retrieval and processing function properly:
1.Create unit tests for each query function.
2.Ensure that the tests cover a variety of scenarios and edge cases.

# Coding Style Tests
Ensure that your code adheres to the PEP 8 style guide. Use flake8 to check for stylistic issues:
pip install flake8
flake8 your_script.py

# Deployment
Use a tool like pip or conda to package your scripts and dependencies before deployment. Install the application on a server with appropriate database access.

# Built with 
**SQLAlchemy**, a database toolkit.
**Pandas** - Data Analysis Library
